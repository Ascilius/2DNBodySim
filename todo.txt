To-Do:

New multi-window/simulation system
 - split panel stuff into separate classes
 - Users can now run multiple simulations in a single session
    - CTRL-N creates a new simulation
    - Use [ and ] to switch between simulations
    - Press [ and ] at the same time to open two simulations at once
       - Select a window with the mouse to change which window you switch
 - Window
 - Simulation
    - 
 - Manager
    - manages windows and sims
    - closes program when theres no more windows or sims
       - or starts a new sim automatically when the last sim is closed?

Save/load scenarios
 - Added scenario loading/saving system
 - Scenarios are now located in json files
 - Custom scenarios can be created from json files
 - Users can use CTRL+S to save a screenshot of the current state of the simulation
 - CTRL-Z saves the state of the simulation from 10 real-world seconds ago
 - CTRL-L opens a file explorer, where json files that contain scenarios can be selected

Efficiency
 - organize functions
 - optimizations
 - sphere of influence
 - multithreading

Improve rewind feature / history
 - dont generate new object for every frame
 - output history file
    - make new player?

 - trail overhaul
    - t-stamp
    - 
 - roche limit
    - variable minMass
 - hill radius
 - gui
    - TOFIX: bodies can still be selected from hidden gui
 - colored gravitational field
 - rewind system
    - move back with pause and arrowkeys
    - overwrite future
    - memory limit
 - better collisions
 - view orbit
 - rotation
 - body placement
 - key input overhaul
 - body locator
    - optimize sorting algo
 - detect display fps
 - disable tidal forces when collisions are disabled
