To-Do:
 - new object: Simulation
 - colored gravitational potential
 - detect display fps

 - rewind system
    - move back with pause and arrowkeys
    - overwrite future
    - memory limit
    - improve rewind feature
       - dont generate new object for every frame
 - trail overhaul

 - save/load scenarios
    - Added scenario loading/saving system
    - Scenarios are now located in json files
    - Custom scenarios can be created from json files
    - Users can use CTRL+S to save a screenshot of the current state of the simulation
    - CTRL-Z saves the state of the simulation from 10 real-world seconds ago
    - CTRL-L opens a file explorer, where json files that contain scenarios can be selected
 - Users can now run multiple simulations in a single session
    - CTRL-N creates a new simulation
    - Use [ and ] to switch between simulations
    - Press [ and ] at the same time to open two simulations at once
       - Select a window with the mouse to change which window you switch

 - placing bodies

 - optimizations
 	- organize functions
    - optimizations
    - sphere of influence
    - multithreading
    - body constructors
    - optimize collisions
 	   - dont create an entirely new object; just update the larger of the two
 

 - hill radius
 - body locator
    - optimize sorting algo

 - view orbit
